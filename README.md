# ttt-clojure
Hi! This is a version of tic-tac-toe using the programming language clojure.  

## Learning goals
* Noticing differences of how functional programming is different than OOP
* Getting more familiar with the Clojure programming language
* How to implement algorithims (minimax or negamax)
* Testing using speclj

## How to run this Project
* First make sure you have leinegen and clojure working on your computer
* Next run `lein deps` in your command line to make sure you have the proper
  dependencies
* To play the game type in `lein run -m ttt-clojure.game` in the comamnd
  line.Currently only player vs player functionality is supported.
* If you would like to run the feature tests type in `lein cucumber`
* If you would like to run the unit tests type in `lein spec`
